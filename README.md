Focuses on **Linux system administration** and **shell scripting**. Some examples of tasks and projects include:
- **User and Group Management:** Scripts for managing users, permissions, and group settings.
- **Network Configuration:** Basic network setup, firewall configurations, and SSH server management.
- **System Monitoring and Automation:** Shell scripts for process monitoring, scheduled tasks (cron jobs), and performance analysis.
- **Security Hardening:** Best practices and configurations for securing Linux servers.

### Network Security
> **Folder:** `Network Security`

Contains code and scripts related to **network security principles** and **cybersecurity protocols**. Topics include:
- **Encryption and Decryption Algorithms:** Implementations of cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA).
- **Intrusion Detection:** Basics of IDS and firewall rules to monitor and control network traffic.
- **Network Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment:** Using tools and scripts to assess network vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Network Design:** Principles of designing secure networks with focus on access control and authentication.

### Presentation-SS
> **Folder:** `Presentation-SS`

Includes **presentation slides and documentation** for various topics covered in the curriculum. These presentations summarize key concepts, providing a quick reference on topics like AI, cybersecurity, data structures, and more.

### Theory of Computation
> **Folder:** `Theory_Computation`

Projects and notes related to the **Theory of Computation**. Key concepts covered include:
- **Finite Automata and Regular Expressions:** Implementation of basic automata and regular expressions.
- **Context-Free Grammars and Pushdown Automata:** Exercises and code for designing grammars and parsing techniques.
- **Turing Machines:** Basic simulations and theoretical problems related to Turing machines and computability.
- **Complexity Classes:** Understanding of complexity classes like P, NP, and NP-complete problems.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
This repository includes both Python and shell scripts. To set up the environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install necessary Python packages (for AI-ML projects) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. For Linux-related projects, it is recommended to have access to a Linux environment (either native or virtualized).


### Virtual Environment

To set up a virtual environment for Python projects, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Virtual Environment** (only needs to be done once):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # For Linux/macOS
   python -m venv venv   # For Windows
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   After activating the environment, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each folder contains a `README.md` or a separate documentation file explaining the specific usage and requirements for the projects in that folder. Please refer to those files for running and testing the individual projects.

## License

This repository is for personal educational use only. Reusing the code outside of this context requires permission.
